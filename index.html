			<h1><small>This website contains information about the course of Computer Science with an Integrated Foundation Year, the requirements an undegraduate should meet and the skills and knowledge they will achieve by the end of the programme. It also provides information about the campus and accommodations around Manchester in order to assist newer students of the Foundation Year that are international or not local ones in getting an opportunity for a better understanding of all key sites. It then also includes contact information of the staff in the Foundation Year programme, so that new students are able to get in touch with the staff in case of any assistance needed.

			<h2><small>This programme will be quite different for the new students of the Foundation Year that are coming from the Sixth Form as it requires much more independent work from the students. It will be not only academic lessons but extracurricular work and cooperative projects with a group of teammates. This approach encourages students from the Sixth Form to acquire time management skills and teaches how to make the right balance between learning in classes, working in groups, and self-organized pre-reading, researching, and testing.
