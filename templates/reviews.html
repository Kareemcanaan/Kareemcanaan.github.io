            <h1><small><span class="big">"</span><span class="it">The University of Manchester provides exceptional opportunities for students from all over the world. On the one hand, the Foundation Year programme significantly and deeply improves academic skills in mathematics and physics and, on the other hand, gives an opportunity to dive deep into university life, learn to think the different way and interact with your team as effectively as possible. The university enables to use language, cultural and country differences, enrich joint work, find an approach to solve common issues and achieve a common result. Up to this point, I have not had such an exciting experience when I could show not only a sense of perception, but also express individual thoughts and my point of view. It is absolutely impressive to know that I have new approaches to problem solving, time management, computer algorithms, methods of solving mathematical and physical problems. I look with hope to the future where I would be able to start my first year studies at the University of Manchester and begin an exciting journey of learning and new discoveries.</span><span class="big">"</span></small></h1>

This is because of me not having any prior experience in programming or computer science as I have never had the chance of doing it in high school or sixth form, this has been an experience that will be helpful in my next year.</span><span class="big">"</span></small></h1>

I have a deeper understanding of how algorithms work and the complex maths that is associated but often not appreciated enough. Overall this year was an experience and I feel as though it has set a solid foundation for me to build from.</span><span class="big">"</span></small></h1>
